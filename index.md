# Hi

I'm Handrata, an App Developer since 2013. Currently enjoying creating Android App using Kotlin.

Often times it's hard to separate time between work, family and pursuing knowledge. So, I want to make a note to myself and hopefully useful to others as well.\
Most of the summary notes I writes will come from other sources, if you are the original writer and you have any objection, please contact me : handrata.samsul@gmail.com or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/handrata-samsul-1517904b/)
