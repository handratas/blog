## Hi

I'm Handrata, an experienced App Developer since 2013. Currently enjoying creating Android App using Kotlin.

Often times it's hard to separate time between work, family and pursuing knowledge. So, I want to make a note to myself and hopefully others.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) 
TDD is a technique for building software that guides software development by writing tests.

In essence you follow three simple steps repeatedly:

1. Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.
2. Write the functional code until the test passes.
3. Refactor both new and old code **UNTIL** it become well structured.

### Test Double
Test double is a general term used by `Gerard Meszaros` to describe any kind of pretend object used in place of a real object for testing purposes.
Using his vocabulary, there are at least five types of Test Doubles:
- Test Stub
- Mock Object
- Test Spy
- Fake Object
- Dummy Object

#### Mock vs Stub
